//! An ECS library tailored to Feather's use cases.
//!
//! This is implemented as a wrapper around Legion ECS, but we've made some interface
//! changes:
//! * Systems are just functions executed sequentially. This simplifies the mental
//! model of how systems are executed. (By contrast, Legion includes a parallel system
//! executor which may provide performance improvements at the cost of worse ergonomics.
//! We have no performance measurements that demonstrate this tradeoff is worthwhile.)
//! * Queries support real, fine-grained change detection, as opposed to Legion's "maybe changed" filter
//! which doesn't suit many of our needs. This again comes at a performance cost, which we may
//! work on optimizing if profiling demonstrates change tracking becomes a bottleneck.
//! * Components are runtime borrow-checked at the per-entity level. This means you can get mutable references
//! to the positions of two different entities at once without unsafe codeâ€”something often required
//! in our codebase. (In comparison, Legion only offers static borrow checking, which is inflexible and often
//! difficult to work with.)
//! * `World` is renamed to `Ecs`, since the term "world" conflicts with Minecraft's concept of worlds.
